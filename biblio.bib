abstract="An increase in the size of data repositories of spatiotemporal data has opened up new challenges in the fields of spatiotemporal data analysis and data mining. Foremost among them is ``spatiotemporal clustering,'' a subfield of data mining that is increasingly becoming popular because of its applications in wide-ranging areas such as engineering, surveillance, transportation, environmental and seismology studies, and mobile data analysis. This review paper presents a comprehensive review of spatiotemporal clustering approaches and their applications as well as a brief tutorial on the taxonomy of data types in the spatiotemporal domain and patterns. Additionally, the data pre-processing techniques, access methods, cluster validation, space--time scan statistics, software tools, and datasets used by various spatiotemporal clustering algorithms are highlighted.",

abstract = {This paper presents a new density-based clustering algorithm, ST-DBSCAN, which is based on DBSCAN. We propose three marginal extensions to DBSCAN related with the identification of (i) core objects, (ii) noise objects, and (iii) adjacent clusters. In contrast to the existing density-based clustering algorithms, our algorithm has the ability of discovering clusters according to non-spatial, spatial and temporal values of the objects. In this paper, we also present a spatial–temporal data warehouse system designed for storing and clustering a wide range of spatial–temporal data. We show an implementation of our algorithm by using this data warehouse and present the data mining results.}
